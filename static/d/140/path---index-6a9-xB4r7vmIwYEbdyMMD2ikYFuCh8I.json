After several years of working in the music industry and playing in a band, I decided to take my interest in programming to the next level. After much self-learning, I eventually enrolled in General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program, where I spent around 12 hours a day for 3 months absorbing all the knowledge my brain could possibly hold. I am now a full stack developer, ready to build awesome stuff and still hungry to learn.
