{"data":{"allDataJson":{"edges":[{"node":{"title":"About","description":"As a kid I dabbled in making text based adventure games, but my first real exposure to code was through my studies of music technology at NYU. After several years of working in the music industry, playing in a band, and making blogs and websites, I decided to take my interest in coding to the next level. I started devouring online courses, and eventually enrolled in General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program (in real life), where I spent around 12 hours a day for 3 months absorbing all the programming knowledge my brain could possibly hold. I emerged as a full stack software engineer, ready to build awesome stuff and still hungry to learn. "}}]}}}
